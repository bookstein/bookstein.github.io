    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I worked on and helped publish a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@newrelic/publish-sourcemap">node module for pushing source maps</a> to a public API. It’s only the second time I’ve worked on a from-scratch node module, and it’s enlightening — like pulling back the curtain to reveal the truth behind the Wizard of Oz.</p>

<p>Node modules aren’t magical (though they&rsquo;re no humbugs either). They fulfill a pretty specific purpose: a way to encapsulate reusable code in a way that’s easily managed.</p>

<h3>Why node modules matter</h3>

<p>Before node modules were really a thing, reusable code snippets were often pulled out into Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs) or stored inside of variables (the Revealing Module pattern).</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var sayAName = (function () {
     var privateName = 'name is not set yet';

     function publicSetName (name) {
          privateName = name;
     }

     function publicSayName () {
          console.log('Hi, ' + privateName);
     }

     return {
          setName: publicSetName,
          sayName: publicSayName
     };
})()

sayAName.setName('emily')
sayAName.sayName()
// 'emily'
</code></pre>

<h5>Example inspired by <a href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript">Addy Osmani&rsquo;s Design Patterns</a></h5>

<p>But with this pattern, you don’t have much ability to manage dependencies or make explicit versioning changes. That’s where node modules are so handy. Not only is the code easily reusable and self-contained, but a version change is as easy as bumping a number in the package.json.</p>

<p>Node modules come in a couple different formats, but the new ES6 format is the one I’m most familiar with.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">// lib/bye.js
export function sayGoodbye(){
  console.log('Bye');
}

// app.js
import { sayGoodbye } from './lib/bye'
</code></pre>

<p>ES6’s native module format uses <code>export</code> and <code>import</code> tokens to share consts, functions, and objects between files.</p>

<p>(I’ve also used <code>module.exports</code> and <code>require</code>, the CommonJS module format, in various projects depending on whether we&rsquo;re transpiling to support ES5.)</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var dep1 = require('./dep1'); 
var dep2 = require('./dep2');

module.exports = function(){ 
  // ...
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Publishing node modules</h3>

<p>Publishing a node module to npm is a pretty sweet feeling &ndash; like getting a book published, except much easier. Although versioning comes with its own quirks.</p>

<p>When working on the node module for pushing source maps, we made several small changes to the 4.0.1 release to fix some tiny bugs. We published those changes to <a href="npmjs.com">npm</a> as pre-releases, indicating that the changes were not yet stable. The pre-release version numbers looked like this: <code>4.0.1-2</code></p>

<p>When you installed <code>@latest</code> or an unspecified version number, though, you got the pre-release instead of the release (4.0.1). That’s not ideal behavior; you want people to be able to opt into prereleases.</p>

<p>Here’s the trick: when publishing to npm, you can tag a release with <code>prerelease</code> or ‘next’ explicitly, which will override the default tag of <code>latest</code>. Then you can make incremental changes to your heart’s content until it’s time for the next real version bump!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week a friend asked me, <em>Is Node is multi-threaded? How would Node do asynchronous work if it&rsquo;s not multi-threaded?</em> Good question! I didn&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>

<p>But as it turns out, Node (and Javascript in general) is <strong>single-threaded</strong>. This means there is only one process, one flow of control. Instead of having multiple threads to process simultaneous work, the Node runtime environment has an ecosystem of interconnected data structures that preserve a fast workflow. At the conceptual center of these structures is the event loop.</p>

<p>All modern Javascript engines rely on an event loop concurrency model, not just Node. So, browser-lovers, read on.</p>

<h2>A stack, a queue, an event loop - oh my!</h2>

<p><img class="[Event loop]" src="/images/event_loop_mdn.png" width="494"></p>

<h6>Image: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop">Mozilla Developers Network</a> (annotations mine)</h6>

<p>This is a simplified diagram of a Javascript runtime. (I added the &ldquo;Web APIs&rdquo; box for browser-related completeness.)</p>

<p>Start with the <strong>stack</strong>. You&rsquo;ve probably been exposed to the stack before, especially in the form of <em>stack traces</em> for  Javascript errors. A stack trace, like the stack itself, is made of the series of functions and local variables that have been pushed onto the stack. Each of those functions and its local variables make up a <em>frame</em> in the call stack.</p>

<p>Functions are added to the stack from the main Javascript program &ndash; or, from the message queue. The <strong>queue</strong> contains callback functions that are ready to be, well, &ldquo;called back.&rdquo; In the browser, callbacks may be associated with DOM events like &ldquo;click&rdquo; or &ldquo;hover&rdquo;; or, for both backend and frontend Javascript, they may be associated with resolved Promises. In fact, they may contain responses from any number of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web APIs</a>, like <code>timer</code> or the infamous <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>. (I didn&rsquo;t realize those were separate APIs until I started learning about the event loop!) When a message is processed, its callback function gets called and thereby is added to the stack.</p>

<p>The <strong>event loop</strong> is the loop that processes messages in the queue such that the callback functions get pushed onto the stack.</p>

<p>For an animated demo of how the event loop works in the browser, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ">Philip Roberts' 2014 JSConf talk</a>.</p>

<h2>Much non-blocking</h2>

<blockquote><p>A very interesting property of the event loop model is that JavaScript, unlike a lot of other languages, never blocks. Handling I/O is typically performed via events and callbacks, so when the application is waiting for an IndexedDB query to return or an XHR request to return, it can still process other things like user input.
&ndash; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#Never_blocking">MDN</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thanks to the event loop model, Javascript is <strong>non-blocking</strong>. That means you don&rsquo;t have to wait for slow tasks to complete before processing other tasks. We just keep pushing or popping frames on and off the stack; some of those function calls add work to someone else&rsquo;s plate (by calling a web API or making HTTP requests, for example), outside of our single process; we receive callbacks in our queue when that external work is done; and whenever the stack has capacity, we pull in those callbacks.</p>

<p>So, even though Javascript is single-threaded, the event loop model allows it to be fast and non-blocking. We just keep grabbing  one thing at a time, one thing at a time, one thing at a time, keep on going forever. We are a <em>machine.</em></p>
